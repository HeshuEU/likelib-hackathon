# LikeLib 2.0

To run the node, a configuration file must be specified for it.
By default it is config.json file of the following format:

```
{
    "net": {
        "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:20203",
        "public_port": 20203
    },
    "rpc": {
        "address": "0.0.0.0:50051"
    },
    "miner": {
        "threads": 4
    },
    "nodes": [
        "127.0.0.1:20204",
        "127.0.0.1:20205"
    ],
    "keys_dir": ".",
    "database": {
        "path": "likelib/database",
        "clean": false
    }
}
```

Notes on parameters:
* `net.listen_addr` - specifies local address and port that the server will listen on;
* `net.public_port` - when node is connected to a remote machine over Internet, its 
public IP gets known, but port - doesn't. We only know the client-socket IP address.
Such things as port-forwarding with NAT, may change the port we need to connect to;
* `rpc.address` - address on which RPC is listening on;
* `miner.threads` - optional parameter, sets the number of threads that miner is using;
* `nodes` - list of known nodes.
* `keys_dir` - key(public and private that was generated by client) folder path. 
if file not exists generate new key pair and save by this path.
* `database.path` - path to folder with database files (will be created if not exists).
* `database.clean` - if true - cleans database; otherwise does nothing.


## Build
1. Run: " sudo .doc/prepare_build.sh ". It will install conan and his dependencies.
2. To generate CMake files use cmake command. 
3. To build project use make command.
4. Go to the bin folder and create config.json with the node settings in it.
5. run the node(keys for the node will be created automatically, if you want to use the already existing ones
you should put hem next to the files with the names lkkey and lkkey.pub)
